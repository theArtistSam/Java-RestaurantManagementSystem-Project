# Restaurant Management System - Java

## Description

The Restaurant Management System is a comprehensive software solution built using Java to streamline and automate various aspects of restaurant operations. It caters to three major sides: Customer Side, Restaurant Side, and Rider Side, along with an Admin Side that grants access to administrators for viewing and managing all aspects of the system.

The system provides an efficient and user-friendly interface to manage restaurant activities, including order processing, customer interactions, delivery coordination, and administrative tasks. Leveraging file handling for data storage, the system eliminates the need for a database, making it easier to deploy and maintain.
